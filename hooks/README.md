# Directadmin hooks: custom PRE and POST action scripts

Directadmin allows to run custom scripts before and after a certain action performed by the control panel.
So called hooks, or hookable events are custom PRE and POST action scripts. Here you can find a list of all custom scripts.

The hook scripts:

- [PRE action hooks are executed before an action in DirectAdmin](hooks_pre.md)
- [POST action hooks are executed after an action in DirectAdmin](hooks_post.md)
